# ModeralRadicalNGOs

This repository contains the data and scripts to reproduce Espinosa & Treich, AJAE, 2021: Moderate vs. Radical NGOs.

It contains three folders with original data and Stata codes.
Note that the do-files must be run in order (1-2-3). 
All scripts are STATA Dofiles, which were run with STATA 14.

a) The "Do-Files" folder:
• 1 - Treat Online: Do-file that cleans and treats the data from the online questionnaire.
• 2 - Treat Data Experiment: Do-file that cleans and treats the data from the lab experiment.
• 3 - Analyze Data: Do-file that produces the tables, tests, and figures of the paper.

b) The "Data" Folder: Contains the intermediary (treated) data.

c) The "RawData" Folder: Contains the original data from the online questionnaire and the lab experiment. Note that we already merged the pre-experimental questionnaire with the experimental data using the email address. We drop the email address for data privacy issues.
